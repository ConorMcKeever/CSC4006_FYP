Factors that Impact Implementing
a System Development Methodology

Tom L. Roberts Jr., Michael L. Gibson, Kent T. Fields, and R. Kelly Rainer Jr.

Abstract—This paper presents the findings of empirical research from 61 companies, mostly from the United States, to identify the
factors that may impact implementation of a system development methodology (SDM). The study uses a survey instrument to
identify the SDM implementation factors. The survey focused on the perspective of the primary constituents: functional managers,
information systems managers, system personnel, and external consultants. The study uses an exploratory factor analysis that
identifies five factors important to implementing an SDM: organizational SDM transition, functional management involvement/
support, SDM transition, the use of models, and external support. The research findings have important implications for further
research and the practice of system development. For researchers, it points to important measures in the implementation and use of
SDMs that may be further verified and extended in subsequent research. For practitioners, it provides a general guide to the
important aspects to consider in the implementation and use of an SDM.

Index Terms—Systems development methodology, analysis and design, project management, life cycle, managers,

1 INTRODUCTION

A

N  important  issue  facing  information  systems  (IS)
managers  is  improving  the  effectiveness  of  software
development  [8].  Many  organizations  are  attempting  to
implement  system  development  methodologies  (SDMs)  to
aid  in  this  effort.  SDMs  can  improve  the  system  develop-
ment  process  once  an  understanding  of  the  fundamental
principles  are  attained  [1].  In  modern  IS  environments,  an
SDM comprises an overall strategy for computer-based in-
formation  system  development  that  includes  a  flexible
framework  of  the  sequence  of  development  tasks  along
with the techniques used to accomplish each task. Unfortu-
nately,  this  definition  is  not  the  only  definition  for  SDM.
The  IS  literature  contains  as  many  definitions  of  SDM  as
there  are  SDMs,  of  which  hundreds  exist.  As  Bachman  [2]
states, “A methodology is a way to skin a cat.” Simply de-
fined,  an  SDM  is  a  way  to  develop  a  system,  and  for  the
purposes of this paper an information system.

SDMs  provide  the  potential  for  helping  to  alleviate  the
software  development  and  maintenance  problems  that
plague many IS departments [25]. Initial SDMs were devel-
oped  to  attempt  answer  complexity  problems  associated
with  system  development  [13],  [16],  [23].  One  study  has
shown  the  need  to  develop  rigorous  methods  to  develop

system  requirements  to  increase  reliability  and  decrease
costs  of  systems  for  organizations  [7].  Other  studies  have
shown that errors late in the development process are more
costly than errors corrected early in the process [4], [5], [7],
[17], [18], [28]. SDMs offer an alternative to risky, informal,
and intuitive system development methods, which are fre-
quently  used  in  practice  [40].  The  use  of  formal  SDMs  is
important for several reasons:

1)(cid:3) they are teachable
2)(cid:3) they  provide  consistency  because  everyone  uses  the

3)(cid:3) they require explicit deliverables that may be checked

same techniques

for quality

4)(cid:3) they  provide  an  engineering-like  development  disci-

pline [3], [15], [22], [29], [39]

Some prominent SDMs include Ernst & Young’s Navigator,
Andersen Consulting’s Method/1, James Martin and Asso-
ciates’  Information  Engineering,  McDonnell-Douglas  Con-
sulting’s Stradis, and CGI’s Marise.

Only recently has attention been directed to the rigorous
adoption of SDMs. This attention is partly due to the prolif-
eration of support tools such as Computer Aided Software
Engineering (CASE) tools. Orlikowski [32, p. 309] used two
case  studies  to  “explain  and  evaluate  different  experiences
and consequences following the introduction of CASE tools
in organizations.” CASE tools simply automate portions of
a  system  development  methodology.  A  more  important
research focus should be to research what CASE tools actu-
ally  automate,  e.g.  an  SDM.  SDMs  should  be  the  primary
implementation  focus  rather  than  the  tools  that  support
automating the methods of SDMs. Several research studies
search  for  the  principles  of  CASE  that  support  system  de-
velopment and compare SDMs [6], [10], [21], [24], [26], [27],
[30],  [35].  Other  studies  have  compared  various  develop-
ment  methods  [20],  [36],  [38],  [41],  [42].  Appendix  A  lists

practitioner  articles  used  as  background  information  on
SDM and research related to SDM.

Many  articles  describe  individual  methodologies  (see
Appendix A). Most articles concerning SDM implementa-
tion  are  anecdotal  and/or  oriented  toward  descriptive
suggestions for the practitioner community. These articles
are  intended  to  be  informative  rather  than  methodologi-
cally rigorous and, in the strictest sense, do not constitute
generalizable research concerning implementing an SDM.
A  number  of  articles  report  actual  cases  describing  the
implementation of a particular SDM. The implementation
of  a  new  SDM  as  a  new  technology  in  the  organization
will  have  a  great  impact  on  the  organization  [33],  [37].
However, an assessment of the literature does not reveal a
generalizable  study  that  identifies  factors  that  impact  the
implementation  of  SDMs.  This  research  provides  a  list  of
five  generalizable  factors  that  impact  the  implementation
of SDMs in organizations.

Our  study  examines  SDM  implementation  from  the
perspectives of the multiple constituents that are involved
in  the  change  process  to  the  SDM  and  application  of  the
SDM  upon  its  implementation.  The  basis  for  our  study
encompasses  answering  our  primary  research  question
that follows.

1.1 The Research Question
What are the factors that profile the organizational changes
that  impact  the  implementation  of  a  systems  development
methodology?

While practitioners and researchers state the importance
of SDMs, very little generalizable research concerning SDM
implementation  exists.  Several  distinct  issues  make  imple-
menting an SDM very important from both researcher and
practitioner points of view. First, the use of an SDM allows
organizations  to  standardize  the  development  process  and
address  system  application  backlogs.  Second,  research
studies and practitioner articles have stated that in order for
an  organization  to  successfully  use  available  automated
tools  to  support  system  development,  they  must  first  im-
plement  an  SDM.  Third,  if  properly  used,  SDMs  should
help organizations integrate business modeling with infor-
mation  system  modeling  and  development.  Integration
helps  to  more  closely  link  IS  with  business  processes.  Fi-
nally, the significant commitment of resources necessary to
implement  an  SDM  makes  smooth  implementation  impor-
tant to every organization.

1.2 Importance of the Research to the Business

Community

IS  managers,  functional  managers,  systems  personnel,  and
external  consultants  should  find  the  research  results  inter-
esting  and  informative.  The  study  provides  a  list  of  the
factors affecting SDM implementation from the perspective
of  the  primary  constituencies.  Practitioners  should  focus
efforts  on  the  key  factors  identified  in  this  study  to  ensure
better  SDM  implementation  in  their  organization.  Re-
searchers should focus further research on verifying factors
and help determine cause and effect.

This paper provides five primary contributions:

1)(cid:3) identification  of  five  key  factors  for  IS  managers  to
consider when attempting to implement an SDM
2)(cid:3) the  rich  content  of  a  preliminary  study  with  experts
and  a  final  study  of  constituents  involved  in  imple-
menting  an  SDM 
in  61  companies  provides  a
grounded  comprehension  of  the  change  aspects  in
implementing an SDM

3)(cid:3) the  creation  of  a  research  instrument  rich  in  content
for  studying  the  implementation  of  methods,  prac-
tices and methodologies

4)(cid:3) an understanding of the central role played by the dif-
ferent  constituencies  involved  in  the  implementation
and use of an SDM

5)(cid:3) providing  an  understanding  of  elements  that  influ-
ence  implementing  an  SDM,  a  fundamental  compo-
nent of system development, an SDM.

2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

This investigation is a theory-building exploratory study to
identify factors that impact SDM implementation as viewed
by primary constituencies. The study was conducted in two
parts:  first,  structured  interviews  were  conducted  with  a
panel of experts; second, using information from the inter-
views,  a  survey  instrument  was  designed  and  mailed  to  a
broad sample of organizations.

2.1 The Preliminary Study
The  preliminary  study  consisted  of  structured  interviews
with SDM experts. Converse and Presser [12] state that it is
necessary  to  interview  experts  in  a  field  for  questionnaire
development.  For  this  reason,  a  panel  of  experts  was  used
to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  research  topic.  Fur-
thermore, the use of experts helped eliminate any bias held
by the researchers.

The  researchers  selected  12  experts  using  citation  lists
and  members  of  a  prominent  business  association.  All  the
experts  are  very  knowledgeable  regarding  the  topic  of
SDM. A content analysis was performed on each interview
transcript. The content analysis permitted the researchers to
“draw out the significance of various levels of analysis and
thereby  reveal  multiple  sources  of  loops  of  causation  and
connectivity  so  crucial  to  identifying  and  explaining  pat-
terns  of  the  process  of  change.”  The  results  of  the  content
analysis  were  compiled  and  collectively  evaluated  with
items  of  importance  to  SDM  implementation  identified.
These items were included in the research instrument. The
constituencies involved in implementing an SDM were also
identified  during  this  analysis.  The  four  primary  constitu-
encies  identified  are:  functional  managers,  IS  managers,
systems personnel, and external consultants involved in the
implementation process.

The term constituency, rather than the term participants,
is  used  to  emphasize  that  individuals  and  groups  not  di-
rectly  associated  with  the  focal  organization  may  form
evaluations  of  the  organization’s  activities  and/or  may  in-
fluence the activities of the organization to some extent [11].
The  multiple  constituency  approach  is  a  method  of  assess-
ing  organizational  effectiveness  from  the  perspectives  of
multiple  strategic  constituents  [9].  Different  stakeholders

have  different  perceptions  of  effectiveness.  The  multiple
constituency approach limits the bias inherent in measuring
effectiveness  from  the  perspective  of  a  single  constituency.
The multiple constituency approach  provides a “structura-
tion  perspective”  [14],  [34]  that  emphasizes  “the  centrality
of players’ deliberate, knowledgeable, and reflective action
in shaping and appropriating an SDM,” [32, p. 310].

Functional  managers,  IS  managers,  systems  personnel,
and  external  consultants  view  implementing  SDMs  from
different  perspectives.  At  the  start  of  the  research  project,
the  researchers  proposed  that  such  different  perspectives
may  lead  to  different  perceptions  of  the  factors  critical  to
SDM  implementation.  Because  all  four  of  these  primary
constituencies  were  involved  in  the  SDM  implementation
process,  the  use  of  a  multiple  constituency  approach  for
identifying  important  factors  is  appropriate  [see  for  exam-
ple,  Hamilton  and  Chervany,  1981  and  Watson,  Boyd-
Wilson, and Magal, 1987].

2.2 Survey Research Strategy
The  survey  research  instrument  used  for  this  investigation
was  a  mail  questionnaire.  The  reason  for  using  the  survey
strategy  is  the  need  for  a  large  sample  representing  the
primary  constituencies.  The  questionnaire  included  infor-
mation  needed  to  evaluate  factors  that  impact  implement-
ing  an  SDM.  Possible  items  related  to  these  factors  were
identified  in  the  expert  panel  investigation.  The  expert  in-
terviews  helped  to  ensure  content  validity  for  the  items  in
the  research  questionnaire.  The  order  of  the  items  on  the
questionnaire was random.

A  rating  6-point  Likert  scale  was  used  to  measure  the
intensity  of  the  response  (See  the  questionnaire  in  the  Ap-
pendix).  The  6-point  scale  was  used  in  preference  to  the
more  familiar  5-point  Likert  scaled  in  order  to  force  re-
spondents to one side or the other regarding agreement or
disagreement  with  the  items:  no  neutral  responses  were
permitted.  Following  each  item  was  an  agreement  scale
ranging  from  1  (Not  At  All)  to  6  (Very  Great  Extent).  Re-
spondents were asked to indicate on the scale the degree to
which they experienced the actual contribution of the item
to SDM implementation in their organization.

Once  the  initial  questionnaire  was  created,  pretest  and
pilot  studies  were  performed.  The  pretest  of  the  research
instrument was conducted among IS faculty and graduate
students at a major university to ensure readable and un-
derstandable  wording  of  the  research  instrument.  A  pilot
study  was  conducted  with  a  major  telecommunications
carrier  that  was  in  the  process  of  implementing  an  SDM.
All  four  constituencies  from  the  company’s  SDM  imple-
mentation responded to the questionnaire. The instrument
was  subsequently  refined  based  on  comments  of  the  re-
spondents.

2.3 Data Collection
The first phase of the data collection effort was the selection
of companies qualified for the study and willing to partici-
pate.  To  qualify  for  the  study,  the  participating  company
had to be at least two years into their SDM implementation
process. The researchers used the literature and contacts at
several  internationally  known  consulting  companies  to
identify potential companies to participate in the study.

An  initial  contact  person  was  identified  for  each  com-
pany included in the investigation. This contact person se-
cured approval to administer the questionnaire in the com-
pany.  Questionnaires  were  sent  directly  to  the  contact  per-
son in a single mailing. The contact person selected knowl-
edgeable  individuals  that  were  personally  involved  in  the
organization’s SDM implementation. The company contact
person selected the individual respondents because of their
personal  knowledge  of  the  SDM  implementation  at  their
organization.  Every  effort  was  made  to  ensure  that  only
knowledgeable  individuals  participated  in  the  survey.  The
contact  person  distributed  the  instrument  to  the  respon-
dents  in  the  organization.  Each  respondent  returned  their
sealed questionnaire to the contact person, who mailed the
collection  of  responses  back  to  the  researchers  in  a  large
sealed envelope.

Most of the companies selected used one, or more, of the
following  SDMs: 
(Table  1)  Andersen  Consulting’s
Method/1,  Ernst  &  Young’s  Navigator,  Texas  Instrument’s
Information  Engineering,  Knowledgeware’s  Information
Engineering,  and  James  Martin  &  Associates’  Information
Engineering. An additional grouping of individual and in-
house,  custom  methodologies  were  also  included  in  the
study.

2.3.1 Sample Demographics
Tables 2 and 3 provide demographics of the companies and
respondents of the study. A total of 61 companies agreed to
participate  in  the  study.  These  companies  represent  many
types of service and manufacturing industries. The sample
of  responding  companies  included  56  from  the  United
States and five from Canada.

Companies in this study represented a variety of indus-
tries,  including  insurance  (13  firms),  manufacturing  (10),
financial  (9),  utility  (7),  communications  (6),  retail  (6),  in-
formation  services  (5),  transportation  (4),  government  (2),
healthcare (1), and petroleum (1). The companies were geo-
graphically dispersed across the United States and Canada.
The  northeast  region  (20  firms)  had  the  highest  number  of
companies, followed by the midwest (10), west (10), south-
east (9), southwest (5), and northwest (2).

A total of 329 surveys were sent to the contact persons in
the  61  companies.  The  companies  returned  192  completed
surveys  for  a  response  rate  of  58.35  percent.  The  largest
number of surveys received from any one company was 8.

2.4 Data Analysis
After completing data collection, a series of analyses were
performed  to  address  the  research  question.  These  analy-
ses  include  an  exploratory  factor  analysis  and  ANOVA
procedures.

2.4.1 Factor Analysis
An  exploratory  factor  analysis  was  conducted  to  find  any
dimensions  underlying  the  items  relating  to  implementing
an  SDM.  This  method  was  chosen  due  to  the  limited
amount  of  knowledge  available  on  SDM  implementation
and the exploratory nature of research.

One of the necessary requirements of the factor analysis
procedure is a large sample. A general rule of thumb is that
the number of subjects should be at least two times greater
than the number of variables [19]. In this investigation, the
number of items used in the questionnaire was 88, with the
192 returned responses meeting the criterion established for
the study.

The  researchers  used  two  criteria  to  evaluate  the  factor
items: significance of item loadings and simplicity of factor

structure.  Using  the  first  criterion,  only  items  with  factor
loadings of at least 0.35 were retained. The second criterion
calls  for  eliminating  items  that  exhibit  factor  loadings  of
0.35 on two or more factors, or items that exhibit no factor
loadings greater than 0.35.

Cronbach’s  coefficient  alphas  were  used  to  test  internal
reliability  of  the  factors.  Cronbach  alpha’s  of  at  least  0.60
were used to estimate reliability for each factor [31].

2.4.2 Analysis of Variance
An  ANOVA  procedure  was  conducted  on  each  research
item after the final factor analysis. This procedure was used
to compare the responses across the primary constituencies.
Each research item was tested at the 0.05 significance level
using  the  F-statistic  to  determine  if  significant  differences
existed across the constituencies.

3 RESEARCH RESULTS

The ANOVA procedure comparing responses from the dif-
ferent  constituencies  failed  to  show  significant  differences
on  any  item.  These  findings  confirmed  the  researchers’  as-
sertion of having a homogeneous sample regarding the im-
plementation  of  an  SDM,  but  did  not  confirm  the  a  priori
assertion that the different perspective of the constituencies
would  lead  them  to  value  different  items  as  important  to
the implementation.

The  exploratory  factor  analysis  procedure  using  a
varimax  factor  rotation  was  performed  for  the  88  items.
No  factors  were  specified  on  this  initial  factor  analysis,
resulting  in  a  21-factor  solution.  An  analysis  of  the  scree
plots showed a drop (1.30 to 0.625) in the eigenvalue lev-
els  and  a  drop  below  2  percent  of  the  variance  explained
after factor 5. These values from the scree plot indicated a
5 factor solution.

A  subsequent  factor  analysis  was  performed  forcing  a
5-factor  solution  and  factor  loadings  of  at  least  0.35.  This
procedure  resulted  in  five  factors  with  eigenvalues  of  at
least  1.68  which  exceed  the  minimum  standard  of  1.0  for
acceptable factors. Ten of the 88 items failed to meet the 0.35
factor  loading  requirement  and  were  subsequently  elimi-
nated 
items
crossloaded  and  were  also  dropped  from  the  analysis.  In
total,  five  factors  explained  43.7  percent  of  the  systematic
covariance among the remaining 65 items.

3.1 Identifying Factors
Five factors were identified in the exploratory factor analy-
sis  procedure  conducted  for  the  study.  The  items  that
loaded  on  each  factor  can  be  identified  and  explained  by
analyzing  Table  4.  The  discussion  pertaining  to  the  factor
analysis  results  tables  describes  the  factors,  their  assigned
latent variable names, and the importance of each factor.

The first factor identified (Table 4) included 28 items re-
lated  to  following  through  with  SDM  implementation.
These  items  were  related  to  SDM  training,  IS  manager  in-
volvement  with  the  process,  and  organizational  change.
The latent variable name assigned to this factor is organiza-
tional  SDM  transition.  This  factor  actually  encompasses  the
change over from the old ways to the new SDM. This factor

is  interesting  because  items  pertaining  to  preparing  and
enforcing the changeover to the new SDM are all part of the
factor.  Preparation  is  essential  for  any  major  change  in  an
organization. A major part of the preparation for employing
a new SDM is adequate training and the application of the
proper resources in terms of knowledgeable personnel and
equipment.  Each  of  these  areas  can  be  identified  by  items
loading  on  this  factor.  The  enforcement  of  the  use  of  the
new  SDM  is  also  included  in  this  factor  through  the  in-
volvement of IS managers. IS managers are the empowered
individuals  involved  with  the  SDM  implementation  proc-
ess.  Successful  implementations  of  SDMs  need  direct  in-
volvement of IS managers. This factor is important because
SDM  implementations  are  difficult  to  complete  without
proper preparation for change and IS manager support.

Factor  2  (Table  5)  consists  of  the  nine  items  associated
with  functional  managers  and  their  relationship  to  the
SDM  implementation  process.  All  of  the  items  relating  to
functional managers loaded on this factor. The latent vari-
able  name  given  to  this  factor  is  functional  manager  in-
volvement/support.  Functional  managers  are  the  chief  pro-
ponents of change in virtually all organizations. The func-
tional management component is a part of the preparation
of  the  organization  for  change  and  enforcement  of  the
change.  The  role  of  functional  managers  is  different  than
IS  managers  in  that  they  most  likely  will  not  be  directly
involved in the new SDM. However, functional managers

provide  resources,  commitment,  and  discipline  for  im-
plementing  the  new  SDM  throughout  the  organization.
Functional  management  provides  resources  in  terms  of
funding, technology, personnel and external training sup-
port.  Functional  management  can  champion  changes  in
the  organization  to  sell  the  new  ideas  to  personnel.  Fi-
nally,  functional  management  can  enforce  the  changes  to
the  new  SDM.  This  factor  is  vital  for  any  type  of  major
change in an organization.

Factor  3  (Table  6)  is  another  transition  factor.  The  10
items included in Factor 3 are aspects of SDM implementa-
tion involved directly with changing to the new methodol-
ogy. The latent variable name for this factor is SDM transi-
tion. Unlike Factors 1 and 2, which address forward transi-
tion  of  SDM  facets,  Factor  3  addresses  understanding  spe-
cific  SDM  transition  phases.  Understanding  the  new  life
cycle  and  activities  of  the  SDM  were  a  part  of  this  factor.
Each  SDM  presents  a  new  system  development  life  cycle
with  distinctly  identifiable  phases.  Personnel  must  know
these phases and the tools and techniques that are used in
each  of  these  phases  for  implementation  to  be  successful.
Additionally, the deliverables of each phase of the life cycle
are  distinct  and  must  be  understood  as  inputs  to  the  next
phase.  This  factor  is  vital  to  the  future  use  of  an  SDM  be-
cause  company  personnel  must  have  a  complete  under-
standing of activities and transitional phases in order to use
the SDM.

Factor  4  (Table  7)  contains  nine  items  related  to  model-
ing. The latent variable name given to this factor is the use
of models. Again, most SDMs use modeling methods. Mod-
els serve the purpose of explaining the business and giving
clear definitions of how the business works to IS personnel
and  end  users.  Knowing  how  and  when  to  use  specific
models  is  a  vital  part  of  IS  personnel  jobs.  IS  personnel
should  understand  the  relationship  between  the  various
modeling  techniques,  where  the  techniques  fit  into  the  life
cycle and what each modeling technique brings to the sys-
tem development process. Additionally, the deliverables of
each modeling technique should be defined and spelled out
in the system development process. The reason this factor is
important to the SDM implementation process is that mod-
els  are  a  functional  component  of  SDMs  that  must  be  un-
derstood before an SDM can be implemented or used.

Factor  5  (Table  8)  includes  nine  items  related  to  the  use
of  external  training  and  consultants.  The  latent  variable
name  assigned  to  this  factor  is  simply  external  support.  Ex-
ternal  consultants  play  a  major  role  in  implementing  most
SDMs, especially in initial implementation phases. Organi-
zations frequently need outside expertise because, in many
cases, no one in the organization has the expertise required
to  effectively  implement  an  SDM.  Furthermore,  external
training  is  frequently  needed  because  internal  trainers  do
not  have  the  specialized  skills  and  expertise  to  develop
training courses and materials. Factors 1, 3, and 4 are areas
where  expertise  from  external  consultants  can  impact  an
organization’s  implementation  of  an  SDM.  External  con-

sultants  bring  knowledge  from  other  implementations  of
SDMs  into  the  organization.  This  knowledge  can  include
training procedures, expertise on the specific methodology
and its phases and techniques, and just simply proof to eve-
ryone  that  other  implementations  of  SDMs  have  been  suc-
cessful in other organizations. The importance of this factor
cannot be overstated if the organization does not have ade-
quate  resources  or  expertise  internal  to  the  organization  to
implement and use the SDM.

4 IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY

This study is valuable to IS developers and researchers be-
cause  it  identifies  key  areas  companies  need  to  address
while implementing an SDM and provides research results
on a baseline IS component, an SDM. The exploratory factor
analysis  provided  very  interesting  results  regarding  what
factors  actually  impact  SDM  implementation.  The  explora-
tory factor analysis revealed that many factor items related
to transition, SDM training, SDM enforcement, and IS man-
ager support all loaded on a single factor. This result is in-
teresting  because  it  reveals  that  most  companies  are  not
currently  addressing  the  important  aspects  of  following
through  with  the  SDM  implementation.  Companies  are
currently experiencing difficulties in dealing with the actual
transition from the old way to the new SDM. The struggle
in SDM implementation seems to lie in the actual transition
from old to new, not the preparation for the change.

Another interesting finding is the lack of significant dif-
ferences  in  the  perceptions  of  the  factor  items  between  the
primary constituencies. It is surprising that each constituent
group did not have their own particular perceptions of the
items but responded in a homogeneous way. This homoge-
neous response may arise from the fact that most organiza-
tions  tend  to  use  their  best  personnel  when  making  major
changes, such as SDM implementation. Companies usually
put their most experienced and skilled personnel on major
projects,  such  as  SDM  implementation.  A  review  of  the
business  and  IS  experience,  and  education  level  of  the  re-
spondents  in  Table  3  reveals  that  most  companies  in  the
study used their most experienced and more educated per-
sonnel during their implementation process.

Although the results of this study should be further vali-
dated  through  replication  and  further  studies  conducted  on
the  subject,  the  findings  of  this  research  identifies  items  of
importance  related  to  the  five  factors  detected  in  the  study
that  should  help  practitioners  attempting  to  implement  an
SDM.  For  researchers,  the  study  provides  a  framework  for
further study regarding SDM implementation.

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The  study  yielded  five  factors  that  should  be  considered
currently  important  to  companies  implementing  SDMs.
The five factors identified are:

1)(cid:3) Organizational SDM Transition
2)(cid:3) Functional Management Involvement/Support

3)(cid:3) SDM Transition
4)(cid:3) Use of Models
5)(cid:3) External Support

The  factors  dealing  with  transition  from  the  old  to  the
new  comprise  the  discipline  of  actually  carrying  the  SDM
processes  forward  in  the  organization.  The  forward  transi-
tion  part  of  the  implementation  process  appears  to  be  the
most troublesome area.

Organizations  allocate  significant  resources  to  imple-
ment  SDMs.  It  seems  strange  that,  although  SDMs  are  not
new, companies still encounter major difficulty when trying
to  implement  them.  This  study  identifies  factors  that  cur-
rently are affecting organizations prior to, and during SDM
implementation.  It  also  pinpoints  current  areas  of  concern
and  valuable  information  for  any  organization  trying  to
implement  an  SDM.  The  authors  believe  that  the  results
here  help  organizational  managers  in  identifying  the  main
areas where they should focus their efforts in implementing
an SDM. By considering the specific items that comprise the
five factors, managers may be able to direct organizational
personnel  in  better  implementing  an  SDM.  By  better  im-
plementing  an  SDM,  these  same  organizational  managers
can better ensure that system development projects be bet-
ter  completed  as  suggested  by  those  authors  of  various
types of books on system development methodologies. The
results  of  this  research  also  provides  a  foundation  for  fur-
ther research on the SDM implementation process.

5.1 Directions for Future Research
This  study  provides  a  basis  for  many  different  avenues  for
future research. A first study should replicate this study with
different  but  similar  samples  using  additional  SDMs  (in-
cluding some object-oriented SDMs). These research projects
should  help  validate  the  constructs  identified  in  the  ex-
ploratory  factor  analysis  of  this  study.  A  broader  interna-
tional  extension  of  this  study  should  also  be  conducted  for
further validation, since many SDMs are being used globally.
Another  valuable  future  study  consists  of  longitudinal
case studies that look at an SDM implementation from start
to finish for different companies using the same and differ-
ent SDMs as in this research. This study could help identify
latent problems and obstacles from a longitudinal perspec-
tive  that  companies  must  address  while  implementing  an
SDM.  The  subject  companies  for  these  case  studies  should
be conducted beginning at the start of the SDM implemen-
tation  processes  spanning  3-5  years  and  encompassing  the
full implementation process.

A  study  that  explores  the  system  development  process
for  organizations  not  having  a  formal  SDM  could  help
compare SDM and non-SDM environments and should be
of  interest  to  many  researchers  and  practitioners.  Such  a
study could provide insight regarding the actual impact of
SDMs on the system development process.

The expenditure of time and effort in implementing an
SDM makes it one of the most serious areas of concern in
modern  IS.  The  study’s  results  provide  a  foundation  on
which  to  base  the  implementation  of  an  SDM.  A  close
scrutiny of an SDM implementation can be performed by
tracking  the  attributes  of  the  items  of  importance  to  the
five factors found in this research.
